Personalized Daily News & Learning Chatbot

The idea is AI-powered assistant that delivers both topic-specific news and structured daily lessons directly to the user via email. Designed especially for students, and professionals, the chatbot combines up-to-date information from platforms like Reddit and NewsAPI with daily micro-lessons generated by large language models such as Gemini. The goal is to make learning and staying updated effortless, one small piece at a time.

Users begin by entering one or more topics they’re interested in—such as “Autonomous Vehicles,” “Computer Vision,” or “Robot Ethics.” The system automatically adds these topics to a Google Sheet, tracks their progress, and schedules daily delivery based on the user’s preferred time. Each day, a background automation process is triggered using n8n, which reads the active topic(s), determines the current lesson part, and sends a personalized email. The email includes two main sections: a short AI-generated lesson tailored to the user’s current level and a brief, up-to-date news summary from multiple sources discussing what the world is saying about that topic.

Users are also allowed to introduce new topics at any time. If a user discovers a new area of interest, they can simply add it to the system, set a start date and preferred time, and the system will handle the rest—breaking it into daily lessons, tracking the learning progress, and shifting the active topic queue without affecting existing ones. The system adapts as users grow, pause, or switch interests, ensuring a smooth and self-paced learning experience.
