# Personalized Topic-Based News Chatbot

## Overview

This project is about creating a **chatbot that automatically fetches daily updates on a user-defined topic and sends them via email**. It acts like a personal newspaper that delivers meaningful, summarized news without requiring the user to search across different platforms.

---

## Problem

Most people only search for information when they need it. Once their need is fulfilled, they stop tracking updates and often forget to stay informed. This leads to:

- Missed opportunities and knowledge gaps.
- Time wasted manually searching multiple sources (e.g., Reddit, news sites, forums).
- No consistent flow of topic-based updates tailored to personal interest.

---

## Solution

A **chatbot-based system** that:

- Automatically gathers daily information on a specific topic of interest.
- Summarizes it in an easy-to-read format using AI (e.g., ChatGPT).
- **Sends the update via email** to the user every day (or at a selected interval).
- Requires zero effort from the user after setup.

---

## Key Features

- ✅ Personalized topic selection (e.g., AI, robotics, climate, tech)
- ✅ Automated web search and summarization
- ✅ Regular email delivery (daily/weekly)
- ✅ ChatGPT integration for clean summaries
- ✅ Customizable schedule and content sources

---

## How It Works

1. **User sets their topic of interest.**
2. The system gathers relevant content via:
   - News APIs (e.g., NewsAPI, Reddit API)
   - Web scraping
   - ChatGPT or similar for summarization
3. At a set interval (e.g., every morning at 8 AM):
   - A summary is generated.
   - The user receives a clean, concise email digest.
