# Personalized Topic-Based News Chatbot

## Overview

The idea is to create a personalized news chatbot that automatically delivers topic-specific updates to users via email at regular intervals. Instead of manually searching for information across platforms like Google, Reddit, or ChatGPT, users simply choose a topic they care about—such as AI, robotics, finance, or any niche interest—and the system handles the rest. It fetches the latest content from trusted online sources using APIs or web scraping, summarizes it using tools like ChatGPT, and sends a clean, concise email digest daily or weekly. This eliminates the need for active searching and keeps users consistently informed in a passive, effortless way. The project is designed to save time, reduce information overload, and help users build a daily learning habit. It is especially useful for students, professionals, researchers, and anyone who wants to stay updated without the hassle of checking multiple platforms every day.

## Problem

Most people only search for information when they need it. Once their need is fulfilled, they stop tracking updates and often forget to stay informed. This leads to:

- Missed opportunities and knowledge gaps.
- Time wasted manually searching multiple sources (e.g., Reddit, news sites, forums).
- No consistent flow of topic-based updates tailored to personal interest.

---

## Solution

A **chatbot-based system** that:

- Automatically gathers daily information on a specific topic of interest.
- Summarizes it in an easy-to-read format using AI (e.g., ChatGPT).
- **Sends the update via email** to the user every day (or at a selected interval).
- Requires zero effort from the user after setup.

## Key Features

- ✅ Personalized topic selection (e.g., AI, robotics, climate, tech)
- ✅ Automated web search and summarization
- ✅ Regular email delivery (daily/weekly)
- ✅ ChatGPT integration for clean summaries
- ✅ Customizable schedule and content sources

## How It Works

1. **User sets their topic of interest.**
2. The system gathers relevant content via:
   - News APIs (e.g., NewsAPI, Reddit API)
   - Web scraping
   - ChatGPT or similar for summarization
3. At a set interval (e.g., every morning at 8 AM):
   - A summary is generated.
   - The user receives a clean, concise email digest.
